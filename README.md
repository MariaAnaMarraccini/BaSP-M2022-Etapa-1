### Week 02.

# HTML of the Trackgenix page.

My name is Maria Ana Marraccini. The following project intends to be the basic HTML structure of the landing page of
"Trackgenix". This landing page was previously designed in the "Figma" platform.

## The system Trackgenix.

This is a web system created for Trackgenix SA, which is important to make it easy for the Human Resources
Department to administrate the work of the employees, organised in projects and teams.

## Structure of the repository.

This project was saved in the main folder "BaSP-M2022-Etapa-1". Inside this folder, another named "Semana-02" was
saved. It was in this last folder where the index.html file was made. The folder also contains an "img" folder,
used for the saving of the images and icons of the HTML structure.

## Structure of the HTML file.

"HTML:5" basic structure was first placed in this proyect. Then, inside of the "body" section,
the header was settled with the first and only "h1" label: The title "Trackgenix". After this,
the "nav" was made. This is were the sidebar menu was placed. A form with a "search" button, a "log in" and "sign up"
button was also made. Other options (positioned in an unordered list) with the redirection of the user
to other section of the same page were also settled. I used the "p" label here for "MENU" and "GET IN TOUCH",
because I just made the header with the "h1" label. Therefore, I couldn't use yet the "h2" label, much less other "h"
labels (h4 would be the more suitable in this case).
After this, a "homepage" id section was designed with some "h2" titles and paragraphs. Images and a "learn more"
button were also placed here.
The following section was "Features" with the making of another unordered list. Then, a "generic"
section with more images, buttons and paragraphs was collocated. Here I started to use "h3" labels.
The "contact-us" was the next section. Here a "form" with "label", "input", "select" and "textarea" was
made. Finally, the "footer" was finished with some "h4" labels and ordered lists.

### Week 03

# CSS of Trackgenix.

The following file intends to be the CSS design of "Trackgenix", taken from the Figma platform. This design
doesn't intend to be responsive, but tries to respect the 1440x1024 measure.

## Structure of the repository. 

This project was saved in the folder "Semana-03", next to "Semana-02" (HTML structure). In order to enter, the
folder Semana-03 must be opened on the browser. Secondly, the file "index.html" of that folder (not the one 
from "Semana-02") has to be clicked. After this, the file "styles" has to be clicked in order to access to the 
entire project styles. There, the "reset" file and a folder named "img" below CSS (which contains all the images of
the project) can be found. That "reset" file was placed in order to return all the browser propierties to zero.

## Structure of the CSS file.

The file contains all the elements, which are predominantly divided in "div" sections. The different elements and classes 
were ordered in their own order of appearence. The CSS properties were placed following the "Guide to good practices and 
conventions", located in the Classroom. Many changes were also made in the HTML file. This was a necessary process in order
to have the page well stylized.
