### Week 02.

# HTML of the Trackgenix page.

My name is Maria Ana Marraccini. The following project intends to be the basic HTML structure of the landing page of
"Trackgenix". This landing page was previously designed in the "Figma" platform.

## The system Trackgenix.

This is a web system created for Trackgenix SA, which is important to make it easy for the Human Resources
Department to administrate the work of the employees, organised in projects and teams.

## Structure of the repository.

This project was saved in the main folder "BaSP-M2022-Etapa-1". Inside this folder, another named "Semana-02" was
saved. It was in this last folder where the index.html file was made. The folder also contains an "img" folder,
used for the saving of the images and icons of the HTML structure.

## Structure of the HTML file.

"HTML:5" basic structure was first placed in this project. Then, inside of the "body" section,
the header was settled with the first and only "h1" label: The title "Trackgenix". After this,
the "nav" was made. This is were the sidebar menu was placed. A form with a "search" button, a "log in" and "sign up"
button was also made. Other options (positioned in an unordered list) with the redirection of the user
to other section of the same page were also settled. I used the "p" label here for "MENU" and "GET IN TOUCH",
because I just made the header with the "h1" label. Therefore, I couldn't use yet the "h2" label, much less other "h"
labels (h4 would be the more suitable in this case).
After this, a "homepage" id section was designed with some "h2" titles and paragraphs. Images and a "learn more"
button were also placed here.
The following section was "Features" with the making of another unordered list. Then, a "generic"
section with more images, buttons and paragraphs was collocated. Here I started to use "h3" labels.
The "contact-us" was the next section. Here a "form" with "label", "input", "select" and "textarea" was
made. Finally, the "footer" was finished with some "h4" labels and ordered lists.

### Week 03

# CSS of Trackgenix.

The following file intends to be the CSS design of "Trackgenix", taken from the Figma platform. This design
doesn't intend to be responsive, but tries to respect the 1440x1024 measure.

## Structure of the repository.

This project was saved in the folder "Semana-03", next to "Semana-02" (HTML structure). In order to enter, the
folder Semana-03 must be opened on the browser. Secondly, the file "index.html" of that folder (not the one
from "Semana-02") has to be clicked. After this, the file "styles" has to be clicked in order to access to the
entire project styles. There, the "reset" file and a folder named "img" below CSS (which contains all the images of
the project) can be found. That "reset" file was placed in order to return all the browser properties to zero.

## Structure of the CSS file.

The file contains all the elements, which are predominantly divided in "div" sections. The different elements and classes
were ordered on their own order of appearence. The CSS properties were placed following the "Guide to good practices and
conventions", located in the Classroom. Many changes were also made in the HTML file. This was a necessary process in order
to have the page well stylized.

# CSS of Trackgenix with FLEX.

This work intends to be the responsive design of Trackgenix using FLEX and Media Queries.

## Structure of the repository.

The work was saved in the new folder "Semana-04". It has inside both HTML and Reset files. It also has the images and, of
course, de CSS files. In order to enter, the folder Semana-04 must be opened on the browser. Secondly, the index-html
has to be clicked. The difference with the previous project is that now the link of GITHUB pages can be clicked. This allows
the person to see immediately the work. This link was placed in this README file.

## Structure of the CSS file.

The CSS design was divided in different files: Header, Sidebar, Main, Footer and Styles. This last file contains the global
elements of the page and those that may not be global (like the "h2" titles, they are not all the same, the first and
second are green), but reperesents great part of the totality of the page. For example, h1 and .main h2 elements
share a big part of the syles, so I decided to put them together in Styles in order to make the code simplier.
The use of Media Queries intends to be responsable and not abusive. It is for this reason that the "flex" properties
are not placed there unless it was really necessary. A lot of CSS code from the previous problematic was also used in this
one. But it is true that a lot has changed with the corrections of Martina. Many classes were removed (others
were created) and a lot was restructured.

## Exercises of Javascript.

This week a lot of exercises of Javascript were made in order to learn how to use the language correctly. To
achieve this goal, 6 files were created: Varables and operators; Strings; Arrays; If else; For; and Functions. 
Each file has different exercises where creativity, ingenuity and logic had to be properly used to get a good
result. 

## Correction of the CSS file.

Last week the CSS using "flex" was made. This week it was intended that some corrections were made. One of the
most difficult tasks was to order the nav without extra divs and without using flex. Some mistakes using media
queries were also corrected.

## Javascript and DOM.

This week a lot of code had to be made in order to validate the forms of log in and sign up. To achieve this goal, two files of javascript were made and the repository was reestructured: The folder of HTML files includes the index, which is no longer outside the rest of the folders, and it is next to the employee-signup.html and the login.html. The css of the rest of the HTML files was made, and all the pages were linked with each other. The sidebar has a button for the redirection of log-in and employee-signup pages. If you
are positionated there and want to get back to index, you can click on the "homepage" button of the sidebar. 
Many functions were created to achieve the goals, specially in the employee-signup.js file, because of the amount of fields. The logic was combined with the use of events.
Some notes in the code were made so I could remember in the future some of the things I made to resolve this problematic.
