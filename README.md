# HTML of the Trackgenix page.

My name is Maria Ana Marraccini. The following proyect intends to be the basic HTML structure of the landing page of
"Trackgenix". This landing page was previously designed in the "Figma" platform.

## Structure of the repository.

This proyect was saved in the main folder "BaSP-M2022-Etapa-1". Inside this folder, another named "Semana-01" was
saved. It was in this last folder where the index.html file was made. The folder also contains an "img" folder,
used for the saving of the images and icons of the HTML structure.

## Structure of the HTML file.

"HTML:5" basic structure was first placed in this proyect. Then, inside of the "body" section,
the header was settled with the first and only "h1" label: The title "Trackgenix". After this,
the "nav" was made. This is were the sidebar menu was placed. A form with a "search" button, a "log in" and "sign up"
button were also made. Other options (positioned in an unordered list) with the redirection of the user
to other section of the same page were also settled. I used the "p" label here for "MENU" and "GET IN TOUCH",
because I just made the header with the "h1" label. Therefore, I couldn't use yet the "h2" label, much less other "h"
labels (h4 would be the more suitable in this case).
After this, a "homepage" id section was designed with some "h2" titles and paragraphs. Images and a "learn more"
button were also placed here.
The following section was "Features" with the making of another unordered list. Then, a "generic"
section with more images, buttons and paragraphs was collocated. Here I started to use "h3" labels.
The "contact-us" was the next section. Here a "form" with "label", "input", "select" and "textarea" was
made. Finally, the "footer" was finished with some "h4" labels and ordered lists.
